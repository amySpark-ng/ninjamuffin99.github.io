		<p>I make games every once in a while</p>
		<p>Most of the time I use <a href="https://haxe.org/" target="_blank">Haxe</a>, with the <a href="http://haxeflixel.com/" target="_blank">HaxeFlixel framework.</a> I do all of the programming in my projects. I often work with others to design and playtest the games.</p>
		<p>Source code for almost every project I've programmed can be found on <a href="https://github.com/ninjamuffin99?tab=repositories">my Github.</a></p>
